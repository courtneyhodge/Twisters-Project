# Twisters-Project
This was an individual project done for my first UVA School of Data Science Blog Post

This data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/tornadoes), which originally is from the [Severe Weather Maps, Graphics, and Data Page](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/).

The column descriptions come from this [NOAA Website](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/SPC_severe_database_description.pdf).
